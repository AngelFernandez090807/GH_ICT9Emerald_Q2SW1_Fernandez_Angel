					<th style="font-family: Bradley Hand ITC;">Generally considered dogkind's finest all- purpose worker, the German Shepherd Dog is a large, nimble, muscular canine of noble character and high intelligence. pious, confident, valorous, and steady, the German Cowgirl is truly a canine nut's delight. German Cowgirl tykes can stand as high as 26 elevation at the shoulder and, when viewed in figure, presents a picture of smooth, graceful angles rather than angles. The natural gait is a free- and-easy witch, but they can turn it up a notch or two and reach great pets. There are numerous reasons why German Goatherds stand in the frontal rank of canine kingliness, but experts say their defining trait is character fidelity, courage, confidence, the capability to learn commands for numerous tasks, and the amenability to put their life on the line in defense of loved bones . German Goatherds will be gentle family faves and loyal guardians, but, the strain standard says, there is a' certain aloofness that doesn't advance itself to immediate and magpie gemütlichkeit.'</th>

					<th style="font-family: Bradley Hand ITC;">The Golden Retriever, an buoyant Scottish dog of great beauty, stands among America's most popular canine types. They're serious workers at stalking and field work, as attendants for the eyeless, and in hunt- and- deliverance, enjoy obedience and other competitive events, and have an endearing love of life when not at work. The Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular canine of medium size, notorious for the thick, lustrous fleece of gold that gives the strain its name. The broad head, with its friendly and intelligent eyes, short cognizance, and straight nib, is a strain hallmark. In stir, Goldens move with a smooth, important gait, and the featherlight tail is carried, as strain suckers say, with a' jocular action.' The most complete records of the development of the Golden Retriever are included in the record books that were kept from 1835 until about 1890 by the gamekeepers at the Guisachan( pronounced Gooeesicun) estate of Lord Tweedmouth at Inverness- Shire, Scotland. These records were released to public notice in Country Life in 1952, when Lord Tweedmouth's great- whoreson, the sixth Earl of Ilchester, annalist and sportswoman, published material that had been left by his ancestor. They handed factual evidence to the stories that had been handed down through generations. Goldens are gregarious, secure, and eager- to- please family tykes , and fairly easy to train. They take a joyful and sportful approach to life and maintain this puppyish geste into majority. These energetic, important gundogs enjoy out-of-door play. For a strain erected to recoup waterfowl for hours on end, swimming and costing are natural pastimes.</th>
